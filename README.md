# ni-labview-cli-custom-operations
This repository contains custom operations that you can add to the [NI LabVIEW Command Line Interface](http://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/software-products/download.ni-labview-command-line-interface.html "NI LabVIEW CLI download").
Note: LabVIEW 2018 or later automatically install the NI LabVIEW CLI.  However, you can also download and install it separately, and it supports LabVIEW 2014 or later.

To add a custom operation, copy the corresponding folder and copy it into this folder:
* (Windows) C:\Program Files (x86)\National Instruments\Shared\LabVIEW CLI\Operations 
* (macOS) /Library/Application Support/National Instruments/LabVIEW CLI/Operations 
* (Linux) /usr/local/natinst/nilvcli/Operations 

Note: For more information on creating your own custom NI LabVIEW CLI operations, refer to this [help topic] (http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/371361R-01/lvhowto/cli_creating_operations/ "Creating Custom NI LabVIEW CLI Operations").
